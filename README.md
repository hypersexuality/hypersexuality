# README

byf:

just a quick note before we chat: i can be a bit sensitive about first impressions, so try not to be too weird right off the bat. i'm weird myself, but there’s a limit to how much I can handle all at once. i get uncomfortable easily, but once we’ve spent some time talking, i'll definitely ease up n we can talk about pretty much anything (including nsfw or insensitive topics).

anyways check out my art
