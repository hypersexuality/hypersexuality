whoever is closed friend with spiritualwhiteout, please do not interact. i was harassed and doxxed while this situation was happening, though i dont think its directly related. still, im not trying to act like a victim, but it scared meâ€” its endangering me

im scared. i should be playing with playdough at my age, not dealing with this

if the harassment goes further, id have to make document about this guy, im sorry

if were not compatible, thats okay. if anyone feels the need to talk badly about me, id rather they just block me instead. ive been told it was both of our faults, and im trying to process that. i know i can be gullible, but im working on it

i just want to feel safe. you can say whatever you want, but please dont harass me. im still a minor, not an adult like you people

i have awful paranoia and im really impulsive. please understand i can be hard to handle sometimes. im not sure if i want to seek forgiveness anymore. ive been betrayed by the same person so many times and keep trusting too easily
