you may int! i dont bite as long as you know boundaries! feel free to comment on my atabook!
btw i prefer if u guys call my ocs/cos bipolar than autism, i am not autistic and was always not. i've been prescribed w mood stabilisers + antipsychotics. i am under therapy, i am not self diagnosed.

byf:
- dni fakeclaimers, anti-recovery, calls urself psychotic/bipolar/delulu etc for funny i hate u gusys, u demonise cluster b disorders (includes npd) n think bipolar r abusive, basic dni criteria
- Btw I will not give any ex friend a chance if u decide to block me randomly w/o explanation. Gtfo if you only value this friendship for only venting/ranting which happens always. Im my own person
- just a quick note before we chat: i can be a bit sensitive about first impressions, so try not to be too weird right off the bat. i'm weird n hypersexual myself, but there’s a limit to how much I can handle all at once. i get uncomfortable easily, but once we’ve spent some time talking, i'll definitely ease up n we can talk about pretty much anything (including nsfw or insensitive topics).

thin ice:
- neurotypical adults
- cis men (sounds funny but i have bad experience w them)
- engage in flag discourse or lgbtq discourse idk man flag is flag (except for pedophiles/incest/harmful paraphilias u arent welcome fuck you)
- i prefer not to interact with underaged systems did/osdd! especially fictive/factive ones. you may crown however
- self diagnosed minors uh

I LOVE TRANS PEOPLE!! PLEASE INT IF URE TRANS I LOVE TRANS PEOPLE (if ur cis then wtv. but if ur trans PLEASE INT!!)
