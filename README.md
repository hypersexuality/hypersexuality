whoever is closed friend with spiritualwhiteout, please do not interact. i was harassed and doxxed while this situation was happening, though i dont think its directly related. still, im not trying to act like a victim, but it scared me— its endangering me

im scared. i should be playing with playdough at my age, not dealing with this

if were not compatible, thats okay. if anyone feels the need to talk badly about me, id rather they just block me instead. ive been told it was both of our faults, and im trying to process that. i know i can be gullible, but im working on it

i just want to feel safe. you can say whatever you want, but please don’t harass me. im still a minor, especially a teen- not an adult like you all

even though i may be turning 18 this year, that doesn’t change the fact that im still underage. the people involved are 20 or older, which is why i said, "still a minor." please read carefully

i have awful paranoia and im really impulsive. please understand i can be hard to handle sometimes. im not sure if i want to seek forgiveness anymore. ive been betrayed by the same person so many times and keep trusting too easily

ill take this down once my paranoia settles, its been a recurring issue for two weeks. it just got worsened by now. for now, the person will stay in my dni until weve both apologized or the situation is resolved. im moving on from the friendship

i dont think anyone is stalking me. people are too busy with their own lives to do that. im just paranoid, and its something im working through. i know my mind tends to overthink things, but i dont want to assume the worst about anyone
