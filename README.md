### **general notes**  
> - you’re welcome to interact! i don’t bite as long as you know boundaries. feel free to sign my **strawpage/atabook**!  
> - **please refer to my ocs/cos as bipolar** rather than autistic. i am **not autistic** and have never been. i have a **bipolar ii diagnosis**, am prescribed **mood stabilizers + antipsychotics**, and am in **therapy**. i am **not self-diagnosed**.
> - i'm psychotic, so please reality check me (with my consent) if i'm experiencing grandiose or delusional psychosis. call me by my real name (**bob**) and not an **irl of someone/something**—unless it's for comfort reasons and i'm actively receiving treatment.

### **do not interact (dni)**  
> - fakeclaimers, anti-recovery individuals.  
> - people who call themselves **psychotic, bipolar, or delulu** for fun—**i hate you** for demonizing actual disorders.  
> - those who demonize **cluster b disorders** (including **npd**) or think bipolar people are inherently abusive.  
> - basic dni criteria (racist, homophobic, transphobic, etc.).  

### **interaction preferences**  
> - **ages 15 below:** do not interact unless **friends**. otherwise, **iwec** if friends—since even friends still shove conversations toward nsfw. i may make exceptions **if you’re asexual and not a <sup>freak**.</sup>
> -  **ages 17+ and adults:** preferred if you want to be **close friends**.  
> - **first impressions matter** to me. i can be sensitive about them, so please don’t be **overly weird** right off the bat. i’m **weird and hypersexual myself**, but i have a limit to how much i can handle at once. if we talk for a while, i’ll **ease up**, and we can discuss **most topics, including nsfw or insensitive subjects**.  

#### **thin ice (be careful before interacting)**  
> - **neurotypical adults.**  
> - **cis men** (i have **bad experiences** with them).  
> - **lgbtq+/flag discourse**—i don’t care, **a flag is a flag** (exceptions: **pedophiles, incest, harmful paraphilias—fuck you**).  
> - **underage did/osdd systems**, especially **fictive/factive ones** (you may **crown**, though).  
> - **self-diagnosed minors.**  i do not want to talk to unmedicated teens, thats all!

> [!NOTE]
> **i love trans people!** please interact if you’re **trans**, i love trans people! (**if you’re cis, whatever, but if you’re trans, please interact!**)
