here’s the organized version in all lowercase for rentry:  

---

### **before you follow (byf)**  

#### **general notes**  
- you’re welcome to interact! i don’t bite as long as you know boundaries. feel free to sign my **strawpage/atabook**!  
- **please refer to my ocs/cos as bipolar** rather than autistic. i am **not autistic** and have never been. i have a **bipolar ii diagnosis**, am prescribed **mood stabilizers + antipsychotics**, and am in **therapy**. i am **not self-diagnosed**.  

#### **do not interact (dni)**  
- fakeclaimers, anti-recovery individuals.  
- people who call themselves **psychotic, bipolar, or delulu** for fun—**i hate you** for demonizing actual disorders.  
- those who demonize **cluster b disorders** (including **npd**) or think bipolar people are inherently abusive.  
- basic dni criteria (racist, homophobic, transphobic, etc.).  

#### **interaction preferences**  
- **ages 15 below:** interact with **caution**
- **ages 17+ and adults:** preferred if you want to be **close friends**.  
- **first impressions matter** to me. i can be sensitive about them, so please don’t be **overly weird** right off the bat. i’m **weird and hypersexual myself**, but i have a limit to how much i can handle at once. if we talk for a while, i’ll **ease up**, and we can discuss **most topics, including nsfw or insensitive subjects**.  

#### **thin ice (be careful before interacting)**  
- **neurotypical adults.**  
- **cis men** (i have **bad experiences** with them).  
- **lgbtq+/flag discourse**—i don’t care, **a flag is a flag** (exceptions: **pedophiles, incest, harmful paraphilias—fuck you**).  
- **underage did/osdd systems**, especially **fictive/factive ones** (you may **crown**, though).  
- **self-diagnosed minors.**  

#### **other notes**  
- **i love trans people!** please interact if you’re **trans**, i love trans people! (**if you’re cis, whatever, but if you’re trans, please interact!**)
