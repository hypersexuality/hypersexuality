# README

byf:
- dni fakeclaimers, anti-recovery, calls urself psychotic/bipolar for funny i hate u gusys, u demonise cluster b disorders, basic dni criteria
- just a quick note before we chat: i can be a bit sensitive about first impressions, so try not to be too weird right off the bat. i'm weird n hypersexual myself, but there’s a limit to how much I can handle all at once. i get uncomfortable easily, but once we’ve spent some time talking, i'll definitely ease up n we can talk about pretty much anything (including nsfw or insensitive topics).

thin ice:
- neurotypical adults
- cis men (sounds funny but i have bad experience w them)

anyways check out my art
