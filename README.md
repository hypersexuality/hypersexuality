dni:
- spiritualwhiteout or any of your friends, i'm sorry, but i don't like you. i don't want to be hoovered and discarded again and again. this friendship has involved a lot of hoovering, breadcrumbing, and one-sided, according to my friends / psychiatrist advice. i'm not a placeholder, okay? maybe try finding someone else
- past exes who ARE adults. i can forgive teens (13-18) for their actions, they're learning from their mistakes. its wrong but its alright
- i block freely idgaf, usually when youre weird
